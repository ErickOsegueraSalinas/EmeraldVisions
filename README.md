## by: Erick Oseguera Salinas

<br> In a world where climate change looms,
<br> Youth leaders rise to break old dooms.
<br> Innovative minds, hearts on fire,
<br> Dreams of green, of lands that inspire.

<br> Community-centric, we take the lead,
<br> Governance for all, a new creed.
<br> Equity in energy, a fair transition,
<br> For a future that's bright, a noble mission.

<br> Eco-literacy, knowledge blooms,
<br> In every child, the earth resumes.
<br> Democracy's future, in young hands,
<br> Voices raised, in all lands.

<br> Climate finance, a key to unlock,
<br> Sustainable futures, not just talk.
<br> With vision clear, we pave the way,
<br> For a greener world, where children play.
 
<br> So let us dream, let us create,
<br> A world of hope, not of fate.
<br> Together, we'll make the breakthroughs,
<br> For a planet that thrives, and future that renews.
<br><br><br> 2024.
