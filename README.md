# EmeraldVisions: A youth's call for climate change
In a world where climate change looms,
Youth leaders rise to break old dooms.
Innovative minds, hearts on fire,
Dreams of green, of lands that inspire.

Community-centric, we take the lead,
Governance for all, a new creed.
Equity in energy, a fair transition,
For a future that's bright, a noble mission.

Eco-literacy, knowledge blooms,
In every child, the earth resumes.
Democracy's future, in young hands,
Voices raised, in all lands.

Climate finance, a key to unlock,
Sustainable futures, not just talk.
With vision clear, we pave the way,
For a greener world, where children play.

So let us dream, let us create,
A world of hope, not of fate.
Together, we'll make the breakthroughs,
For a planet that thrives, and future that renews.
